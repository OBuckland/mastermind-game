### **Functionality**
The winning combination of colours are randomly selected for each new game. When the player clicks the check button the users guess will be marked with red or white pins to help the user make their next guess. The game does not allow the user to select the same colour more than once, and cannot have their guess marked unless all four guesses have been added. There is also a help button, which gives a summary how the scoring works. There is also a reset, delete and home button. When the player wins a modal will appear and give the user the choice of playing again or going back to the home page.
