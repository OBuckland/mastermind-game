        <h1>Mastermind</h1>
        <p>Mastermind is a code breaker game. 
            The aim of the game is to find the exact colour and position  of each peg within the sequence to break the code.
            </p>
        <p>How do you play?

            Selecting a colour will add it to your sequence guess. Each colour will only be used once per sequence.
            Once you have made your guess hit the check button and the Mastermind will give you feedback.
            A red pin indicates that one of your colours is in the sequence and also in the correct position. A white pin indicates you have the right colour but it is in the wrong position. 
            And no pin indicates that colour is not in the sequence. However you will not know which colours are the correct ones after scoring. </p>
        <p>Through careful logic and deduction you must crack the code by your tenth guess in order to win the game!</p>
